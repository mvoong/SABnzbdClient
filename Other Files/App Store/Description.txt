This is the easiest and slickest way to search and download binary files from Usenet on your iPhone or iPod Touch with SABnzbd.

This has been built to be a very stable and fast app - it will not crash every few minutes like some other SABnzbd apps.

Features:

* Search for binaries using your favourite NZB indexers
* Find recent binaries using NZBMatrix RSS feeds
* Sort search results by hits, date, size or name
* Filter searches by category (NZBMatrix)
* View cover artwork (NZBMatrix)
* Jump to title in IMDB
* Start downloads and organise by category
* Quickly add downloads by long-pressing the result
* View and delete your download history
* Manage multiple SABnzbd servers
* Change download category, priority and postprocessing script
* Pause your download queue
* Set a speed limit on your download queue
* Cancel downloads
* Reorder downloads
* HTTPS support
* FREE regular updates

This version supports the popular NZBMatrix and BinSearch. Based on popular request, I will add your favourite indexer for FREE!

Please note that this application does not connect directly to Usenet. You need a working SABnzbd setup.
